# Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into
# two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or
# false otherwise.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 200
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
#
